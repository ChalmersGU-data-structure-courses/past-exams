This was the main exam for DAT495.

It was also a re-exam for DAT038/7, TDA416/7, DAT525, DIT182/1, LET375, and DIT961.

## Versions

There were two versions of the exam, one for DIT961 and one for the other courses.
Some questions are shared between the two versions.

## Mistakes

The non-DIT961 version has a minor mistake in Question 1B.
In Question 1B, the complexity requirement should have been only O((k + n) log(n)) instead of O(k + n log(n)).
We accept solutions with either of the two complexities.
Note that a solution in O(k + n) is possible.
