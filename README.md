# Past exams

This repository collects past exams from data structure courses at Chalmers University of Technology and Gothenburg University.

## Repository structure

The exams are sorted by course code.
In each course code folder, each exam is a folder of format `yyyy-mm` (sample exams use e.g. `yyyy-mm-sample-N.`)
If an exam is given in multiple courses, one primary location is selected and the others are symbolic links to it.

The exam folder contains the exam `exam.pdf` and suggested solutions `solution.pdf`.
It may also contain a file `README.md` that describes peculiarities of the exam such as:
* if the exam was online (open-book),
* personalized instances with an example if needed,
* questions based on outdated course material.

Some course code folders contain an overview file `README.md`.
This file links the exams with solutions and annotations from the exam `README.md` for convenience.
Note that the GitHub web interface is not able to resolve symlinks, so this has to be done manually at this point.
It also links to exams from similar courses.
