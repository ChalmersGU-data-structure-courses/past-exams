# Past exams

This repository collects past exams from data structure courses at Chalmers University of Technology and Gothenburg University.

## Repository structure

### Old exams

Older exams are in `old exams` and sorted by course code.
Within each course code, they are sorted by date in the format `yyyy-mm`.

### New exams

Newer exams are sorted by date in the format `yyyy-mm-dd`.

Some folders have a file `README.md` noting:
* what course(s) this was a (re)exam for,
* if the exam was online (open-book),
* personalized instances with an example if needed,
* questions based on outdated course material.

Some folders have some of this information is a separate coversheet `coversheet.pdf`. 
The folder typically contains the original exam `exam.pdf` and suggested solutions `solution.pdf`.
If there are several versions (for example, for different course codes), there may be several such files, for example in appropriately named subfolders.

### Pandemic exams

All exams during the Covid-19 pandemic were online and open-book. This meant that the questions were quite different from the "normal" closed-book on-campus exams. Many of the pandemic exams were also individualised, so that every student got a slightly different question. The pandemic exams were from 2020-04-30 until 2021-08-27.
